## Find the Difference

Given two strings `s` and `t` which consist of only lowercase letters.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in `t`.


## Example

```javascript
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### code

In this problem, we are given 2 strings and we need to find the extra `Char` in them. We know that each `Char` has a value and we add them up to get a total value of the `string`, we can subtract one from the other and that will give us a value we can the use `String.fromCharCode` to get the extra `Char`. We did create a helper fucntion to get the word value.

```javascript
 findExtraLetter(t, s) {
    return String.fromCharCode(this.wordSum(s) - this.wordSum(t));
  }

  wordSum(word){
    let sum = 0;
    word.toLowerCase().split('').forEach(temp => {
      sum += temp.charCodeAt(0);
    });
    return sum;
  }
  ```
